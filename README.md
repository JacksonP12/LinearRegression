# LinearRegression

Unfortunately, I was unable to plot the linear regression of the amount of carbon emissions (in metric tons) over time. There was an error was unable to be fixed. However, from just the scatterplot, I learned that over the past 50 years, the amount of emissions slowly grew (they started at around 4.2 billion), peaking around 2008, before falling back down to what are levels similar to those in the 1990s (around 5 billion).
